# Welcome to the Blog

This is your first blog post. You can start writing content in Markdown and MDX format.

## Getting Started

To add a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in the `/content/blog/` directory
2. Add frontmatter at the top with required fields (`title` and `date`)
3. Write your content below using Markdown or MDX

## Features

- **Frontmatter**: Add metadata like title, date, description, tags, and more
- **MDX Support**: Use React components directly in your posts
- **Draft Posts**: Set `draft: true` to hide posts in production
- **Tags**: Organize your posts with tags
- **Series**: Group related posts with a series name

Happy writing!
