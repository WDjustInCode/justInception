## What I’m building

My studio site is a Next.js marketing and portfolio site. It started as a straightforward “services + work” site, and over time it became the primary way I present my work publicly.

Now I’m adding **WordPress as a headless CMS** behind that same Next.js frontend. The goal is to keep the modern frontend, Next.js, while plugging in WordPress, a CMS that is widely used and commonly expected in real-world projects.

In short:

- **Next.js stays the frontend.**
- **WordPress becomes the content backend.**

## Why headless WordPress (and why now)

While searching for new opportunities, I noticed something consistent: WordPress roles are still very common, and many teams rely on WordPress for managing content.

I already have strong momentum with Next.js, so rather than switching platforms entirely, I’m using this project to demonstrate something I expect to do in real work environments:

> Integrate a well-established platform like WordPress into a modern frontend stack like Next.js in a way that is maintainable, secure, and performant.

This is also a portfolio upgrade. It turns my site from “static marketing pages” into a real content platform with:

- editable case studies and project writeups  
- publishable build logs (like this series)  
- a cleaner content workflow that does not require code changes for every copy update  

## Why not just build a traditional WordPress theme?

Traditional WordPress theming is still a great solution in many cases, especially when plugin compatibility and simplicity matter more than frontend architecture.

For *this* site, I’m specifically optimizing for:

- modern frontend performance patterns (SSR, SSG, and ISR)  
- a component-driven UI system  
- full control over routing and page composition  
- reducing the public-facing WordPress attack surface  

Headless isn’t automatically “better.” It’s a trade-off. This project is about understanding those trade-offs and implementing them intentionally.

## Guiding principles for this build

I’m trying to keep this effort realistic and production-minded:

### 1) WordPress is a CMS, not a page builder
WordPress will store structured content and media. Next.js will own layout and presentation.

### 2) Incremental milestones over a “big bang”
I want each step to be shippable and reviewable. The site should stay stable throughout the process.

### 3) Stable URLs and minimal future churn
I’m keeping blog routes stable (`/blog` and `/blog/[slug]`) so I can migrate from local MDX to WordPress without breaking links.

### 4) Keep the seam clean
The frontend should depend on a small data-access layer so swapping content sources (MDX → WPGraphQL) doesn’t require rewriting pages.

## Current state (what’s already done)

Before wiring up WordPress, I implemented a small blog feature inside the Next.js App Router:

- `/blog` index  
- `/blog/[slug]` post pages  
- MDX content stored locally in `content/blog/*.mdx`  
- frontmatter metadata (title, date, tags, etc.)  

This is intentionally temporary. It lets me start publishing immediately, and it sets the URL structure I’ll keep when WordPress becomes the source of truth.

## The plan (high level)

Here’s the initial roadmap. I’ll write follow-up posts as each milestone lands.

### Milestone 1: Headless WordPress foundation
- Provision a WordPress instance (local first, then hosted)
- Install and configure WPGraphQL
- Define content modeling conventions (posts, tags, featured images, etc.)

### Milestone 2: Read path in Next.js (MDX → WPGraphQL)
- Implement a WordPress-backed blog data layer
- Swap `/blog` and `/blog/[slug]` to read from WPGraphQL
- Keep routes and UI stable

### Milestone 3: Preview and editorial workflow
- Draft previews from WordPress into Next.js
- Decide on an authentication approach for preview endpoints
- Validate the authoring workflow end-to-end

### Milestone 4: Revalidation strategy
- Start with ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)
- Add on-demand revalidation via WordPress webhooks
- Confirm caching behavior and deployment environment specifics

### Milestone 5: Migrate portfolio content into WordPress
- Case studies and project entries as structured content
- Tie project pages to related posts (devlog relationship)

## What I’ll share publicly (and what I won’t)

I’ll share architecture decisions, implementation notes, and lessons learned.

I won’t share anything proprietary from client work or from any internal systems I’ve worked on. This series is strictly about building and documenting a public portfolio project.

## Next up

Next post: I’ll define the WordPress content model and the GraphQL queries I want my Next.js site to depend on. That will become the contract between the CMS and the frontend.
